Ingret "Keeper"

Why is everything in smoke?
Darling, tell me
I recognize your steps from a thousand
They are behind me

We found our home
Flowers bloom in it
I would like to stay
But it's time for you to go
We found our home
Flowers bloom in it
I would like to stay
But it's time for you to go

We are mothers, we are brides
We are daughters, we are the light

We are mothers, we are brides
We are daughters, we are the light
We are mothers, we are brides
We are daughters, we are the light
